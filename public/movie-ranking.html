<h1>The Best 3 Movies that Kick Ass</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Hangover</h3>
<p>Unknown element at the time. Laughed so much.</p>

<h3>Megamind</h3>
<p>
  Watched it randomly, and had no idea about the characters. Another hilarious
  film!
</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
  A masterpiece in the trilogy. The Joker performance was immense. Christian
  Bale is always a class act.
